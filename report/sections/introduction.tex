\section{Report Structure}
The report is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \cref{ch:background} presents a summary of abstract syntax, as described by Harper\cite{harper}, which is a central part of the editor calculus proposed by \cite{aalborg}, both
          subjects inherently playing an important role in the implementation of the editor.
    \item \cref{ch:implementation} describes the implementation of the editor, from parsing abstract syntax to generating source code for an editor instance.
    \item \cref{ch:examples} provides examples of the editor in use for different languages, demonstrating the editor's generic nature.
    \item \cref{ch:conclusion} concludes the report, summarizing the project and suggesting future work.
\end{itemize}
