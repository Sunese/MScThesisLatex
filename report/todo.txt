- make TOC only make up 1 page
- write about how it is hard to
    define an abstract syntax with binders
    - write about binders can only be same type 
        - ^^ maybe also not that this is not clear in 
            Harper's definition (and therefore the generalized)
            calculus if bound variables can be of different
            sorts. Is it so?
    - note about how binders' variables are not stored in the model,
    only the generalized arity is.
- editor examples
    - write about substitution:
    - algorithm
    - pseudocode
    - generated functions
- re-read impl. section on conditional, seq. etc.
- some text for the summaries of gen. editor calculus / harper
    can be very short.
    - same for editor examples
- replace typeclass example with a more interesting one
- Hans' comments
