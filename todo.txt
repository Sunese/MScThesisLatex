Implementation:
    - Specification language subsec: 
        specification language in BNF notation
    - Decomposing trees section:
        - add (functional) pseudocode for decomposition algos
        - consider if they should replace code exs
        - add note about only having the cursor in
          root for well-formed trees 
    - replace typeclass example with a more interesting one
    - cursor path subsubsec
        - fill out the generated fun example
    - generating source code subsec
        - add pseudocode for creating types for each sort
    - editor examples
    - conclusion
