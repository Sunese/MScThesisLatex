- Have chatgpt generate pseudocode for algos

- codegen parent and substitution and write about them
  (perhaps have chatgpt do it)

- have chatgpt write conclusion and abstract

needs writing:
    - Specification language subsec: 
        specification language in BNF notation
    - Decomposing trees section:
        - add (functional) pseudocode for decomposition algos
        - consider if they should replace code exs
        - add note about only having the cursor in
          root for well-formed trees 
    - replace typeclass example with a more interesting one
    - editor examples
    - conclusion
