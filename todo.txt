needs writing (prioritized):
    - make TOC only fill up 1 page
    - write about how it is hard to
        define an abstract syntax with binders
        - write about binders can only be same type 
        - note about how binders' variables are not stored in the model,
        only the generalized arity is.
    - editor examples
        - write about substitution:
        - algorithm
        - pseudocode
        - generated functions
    - re-read impl. section on conditional, seq. etc.
    - some text for the summaries of gen. editor calculus / harper
        can be very short.
        - same for editor examples
    - replace typeclass example with a more interesting one
    - Hans' comments
