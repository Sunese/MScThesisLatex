needs writing (prioritized):

    - write about only APCs (cursor movement and subst.) being implemented
        both in implementation and conclusion

    - refine example languages (make them prettier)
    - make example for latex
    - editor examples
    - conclusion
    - replace typeclass example with a more interesting one
