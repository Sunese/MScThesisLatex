\section{Introduction}

This project explores the implementation of a generalized, type-safe structure editor, based on a proposed calculus\cite{aalborg}.

The report is structured as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Section 2 provides a brief overview of prior work, including structure editors, editor generators and partial evaluation, which are relevant to the project.
    \item Section 3 presents definitions of abstract syntax, as described by Harper\cite{harper}, which is a central part of the editor calculus proposed by \cite{aalborg}.
    \item Section 4 provides a summary of the generalized editor calculus\cite{aalborg}, which is the basis for the implementation of the editor.
    \item Section 5 describes the implementation of the editor, from parsing abstract syntax to generating source code for an editor instance.
    \item Section 6 provides examples of the editor in use for different languages, demonstrating the editor's generic nature.
    \item Section 7 concludes the report, summarizing the project and suggesting future work.
\end{itemize}
