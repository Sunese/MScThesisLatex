This thesis investigates the development and implementation of a type-safe, generalized syntax-directed editor. The goal is to create an editor capable of supporting any language, including but not limited to programming languages. The foundation of this work is a proposed generalized editor calculus, encoded in an extended lambda calculus.

The report details the implementation process, encompassing the representation of abstract syntax, source code generation, and the handling of editor expressions. The implementation, written in Elm, features a language specification parser and a source code generator. Currently, the generated editor for a given language can perform basic edits on the abstract syntax tree, such as cursor movement and substitution.

Practical examples are provided for subsets of different languages, including C, SQL, and LaTeX, demonstrating the editor's versatility.

The thesis concludes with proposals for future work, including the implementation of missing editor expressions, views of the program being edited, and exploring the use of typeclasses in languages other than Elm.
