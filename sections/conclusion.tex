This project was exploratory in nature, aiming to implement a generic editor
based on the work of the Aalborg project\cite{aalborg} and other related work.

Only atomic prefix commands have been implemented, including the ability to
move the cursor and perform substitutions. This was a necessary first step
to implement the remaining editor expressions, which unfortunately were not
completed. This however has led to a minimal viable product, which is a
program that can instantiate a syntax-directed editor for any language, where basic edits can be performed on the syntax tree directly.

\subsection{Future work}
Editor expressions for the remaining commands should be implemented, this is possible by following a similar approach to the one used for the atomic prefix commands, i.e. by implementing function generators for each command based on its semantics.


Different views is also a feature that could be implemented, allowing for the editor to display the syntax tree in different ways, such as a tree view or string-format (i.e. pretty-printing). The model in the implementation is already designed to hold the concrete syntax of an operator, allowing for pretty-printing to be implemented with relative ease.

There is currently no active use of binders in the editor, leaving 
out the possibility of potentially checking for use-before-declarations or 
shadowing. However, the model in the implementation does hold information about binders, making future work on this easier.

Given the generic nature of the editor, it would be interesting to see
an implementation in a language with support for typeclasses, such as Haskell.
This should allow for a more concise implementation overall, being less rigid
than the current implementation, since it relies on references to functions and
data types via a low-level interface in the Elm CodeGen package, which refers
to them with manipulated strings
This is in contrast to typeclass
instances, which would allow for a more abstract representation of a tree
of any sort.
