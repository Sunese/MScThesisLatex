\chapter{Editor Examples}
\label{ch:examples}

The following will show from start to finish, how the implementation
can be used to instantiate a syntax-directed editor for the C language (\cref{ex:c-spec}),
SQL (\cref{ex:as-sql-lang}) and \LaTeX \ (\cref{ex:as-latex-lang}).

Each section will first show what the computer-friendly and parseable syntax
for each language looks like, followed by an excerpt of the generated
source code for the editor instance. Only an excerpt is shown, as the
generated source code can be quite large, and over 4000 lines for the C language
syntax specifically, with the current implementation. The complete generated
editors can be found in the "examples" directory of the source code repository.

Finally, a demonstration of the editor
in action will be shown using the Elm REPL, where a sample tree built
from the generated algebraic data types is manipulated with the generated functions.
